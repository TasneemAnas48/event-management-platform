## Rendering Strategies

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

- `/login` - Uses CSR for dynamic form handling and real-time validation

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

- `/` (Homepage) - Uses SSR for initial event listing and SEO optimization
- `/event/[id]` - Uses SSR for event details to improve SEO and initial load performance

### Hybrid Approach

- `/my-events` - Combines SSR for initial data fetch with CSR for dynamic updates
- `/admin` - Uses SSR for initial data load with CSR for real-time updates

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Route Groups

- Used Next.js route groups `(auth)`, `(dashboard)`, and `(website)` for better organization
- Separates concerns and allows for different layouts per section
- Improves code maintainability and scalability

### 2. State Management

- Redux for global state (auth, events, bookmarks, register)
- React Query for caching (fetching events for website)
- Local storage for persistent data (bookmarks, registrations)

### 3. Component Architecture

- Feature-based component organization
- Reusable UI components (RComponents)
- Dynamic imports for code splitting

### 4. Security

- AuthGuard and GuestGuard for route protection
- Centralized authentication logic
- Prevents unauthorized access

### 5. Database

- Use mock data for database

## Scaling Considerations


### 1. Performance
- Use CDN for static assets and images
- Implement infinite scroll for large datasets

### 2. Database Integration
- Migrate from mock data to a real database by integrating with an API


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
